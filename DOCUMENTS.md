## 📜 " Why Do I Face Conflicts In Merging Branches? "

Git Is Here To Help Us Manage Our Projects And Diffrent Versions And Releases. Everyone On A Team, Work On Diffrent Branches And Until They Aren't Done With Their Own Branches, The Shouldn't Merge Their Branches With The Main Branch.

**So What Happens?**

Imagin You And Your Friend are Working On Your Own Branches. You Are Developing A 'COMMENTS' Feature To Your Website And Your Friend Is Developing A 'Dushboard' Feature. Now Both Of You Are Done With Your Job And Are Ready To Merge Your Branches Into The Main Branch. Everything Seems To Be OK, Doesn't It?
But As You See, Git Can't Merge Your Branches. Because There Are Two Diffrent Branches Trying To Be Merged With The Main
Branch And Git Is Not Sure About Which Branch Is The Correct One To Be Merged!
Git CAN NOT Set Priorities. And If You Are Trying To Merge MANY Branches With ONE Branch, You Must Specify How It Should Exactly Happen.
